    DEPENDENCY CHECK SUPPRESSION FILE
    
    This file allows you to suppress false positives or known issues
    from the OWASP Dependency Check scan.
    
    WHY THIS EXISTS:
    - Sometimes scanners report vulnerabilities that don't apply to your use case
    - Some vulnerabilities may be accepted risks with mitigations in place
    - False positives can block pipelines unnecessarily
    
    IMPORTANT: Document WHY each suppression exists!
    In a real project, each suppression should be reviewed and approved.
